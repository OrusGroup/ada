   > I found [X] accessibility issues, including [Y] critical errors that would need to be addressed before the April 2026 deadline.
   >
   > I'd love to show you what I found and discuss how we can help the City of Bowie meet the federal requirements. Would you have 45-60 minutes this week or next for a meeting?
   >
   > I can bring:
   > - A live demonstration of our scanning tool
   > - A detailed report of current issues
   > - A comprehensive roadmap to compliance

## 💡 KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE

### Your Unique Value

1. **"We've already done the work"** (scanner running, HTML report ready)
2. **"We use what you already have"** (Adobe, Office, SharePoint)
3. **"We train your team"** (sustainability, not dependency)
4. **"Hybrid approach"** (human expertise + AI efficiency)
5. **"No vendor lock-in"** (you own the dashboard, we build it)

### Pricing Positioning

- **Don't lead with price** - Lead with value (demo)
- **Present 3 tiers** - Good ($65K) / Better ($95K) / Best ($120K)
- **Recommend Tier 2** - "Comprehensive, best value, addresses all requirements"
- **Show recurring value** - "Dashboard subscription keeps you compliant 24/7"

### Objection Handling

- **"Too expensive"** → ROI: Lawsuit costs $60K-200K vs. $95K solution
- **"Can't we use CivicPlus checker?"** → "Great tool, but limited - doesn't check third-party content"
- **"We'll do it ourselves"** → "We train your team to maintain compliance - you need expertise to get there first"

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Can I use this scanner for other clients?**  
A: YES! It's completely reusable. Just change the URL.

**Q: What if they want to negotiate on price?**  
A: Offer payment plan (40% / 30% / 30%) or reduce scope (but show what's excluded).

**Q: What if they ask for references?**  
A: Be honest. If this is your first accessibility project, position yourself as:
- "Specialist in AI-powered compliance solutions"
- "Leveraging latest tools (Pa11y, Axe) used by enterprises"
- "Can provide technical references in web development / project management"

**Q: Should I hire anyone before contract signed?**  
A: NO. Wait until contract is signed to reduce risk. Then hire Web Accessibility Specialist (critical role).

**Q: What if I don't have IAAP certification?**  
A: Acknowledge it: "I'm currently pursuing IAAP WAS certification. In the meantime, we'll partner with IAAP-certified consultants for validation." Or hire someone who has it.

**Q: Can I build this myself (solo + AI)?**  
A: YES, but it's risky (burnout, timeline). Recommended: You = PM + 2-3 specialists (Web Accessibility, Power BI, Document Remediation).
