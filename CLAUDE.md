## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Client**: City of Bowie, Maryland  
**Primary Contact**: Todd, Director of Communications

**Deadline**: April 24, 2026 (federal mandate)  
**Meeting Date**: Week of December 16-20, 2025

## STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE

### Agent Architecture Strategy (Hybrid Approach)
**Decision**: Use human team members as "agents" with AI assistance + autonomous tools  
**Rationale**:
- Government consulting requires human accountability
- Liability and complex decisions need human judgment
- Client expects expert consultants, not just AI
- BUT: Tools we build (scanner, dashboard) should be autonomous

**Our "Agent" Team Structure**:
1. **Meta Agent** (You) - Oversee entire project
2. **Website Auditor** - Human using AI-powered scanning tools
3. **Document Remediation Specialist** - Human using Adobe/CommonLook + AI assistance
4. **Training Developer** - Human creating custom training materials
5. **Dashboard Developer** - Build Power BI + automation systems

**Autonomous Components**:
- Pa11y scanner (runs automatically)
- Power BI dashboard (auto-updates)
- Alert systems (trigger without human intervention)
- Recurring scans (scheduled automation)

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM DISCOVERY

### Client's Existing Tools (Leverage, Don't Replace)
- **Laserfiche Cloud** - Document management system
- **CivicPlus CMS** - Website platform (has limited built-in checker)
- **Adobe Acrobat Pro** - Available via CD-ROM subscription
- **Microsoft 365** - OneDrive, SharePoint (underutilized - strategic opportunity)
- **Internal File Servers** - Legacy storage (VPN access only)

### Strategic Positioning
- Todd wants to modernize toward OneDrive/SharePoint
- Opportunity: Position SharePoint as "compliant by default" repository
- Don't oversell new software - use what they have, add what they need
- Differentiation: Bring live demo scanner to proposal meeting

### Competition
- Likely competitors bring PowerPoints and proposals
- Our advantage: Live scanner showing real issues on their website
- Proves capability before contract signed

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Primary Automated Scanner: Axe DevTools + Pa11y
**Why**:
- Axe is industry standard (Deque Systems)
- Pa11y is free, open-source, perfect for automation
- Node.js based (easy to script and integrate)
- Can build proof-of-concept quickly

### Dashboard: Custom Power BI (Recommended over SaaS)
**Why**:
- Client already has Microsoft 365
- Familiar interface for city staff
- We control it (no vendor lock-in)
- **Recurring revenue opportunity**: $2,000-4,000/month management subscription
- SiteImprove/Monsido cost $20K-50K/year (too expensive for mid-size city)

### Manual Testing Still Required
- Automated tools catch 30-40% of issues
- Keyboard navigation testing (manual)
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Real user experience validation

## OPEN QUESTIONS / RESEARCH NEEDED

### Document Volume
- **Question**: How many PDFs in Laserfiche?
- **Impact**: Determines if we need Equidox ($5K-20K/year) for batch processing
- **Action**: Ask Todd for inventory count

### Third-Party Vendors
- **Question**: Full list of vendors (Munis, ActiveNet, others?)
- **Action**: Request VPATs from all vendors
- **Risk**: Vendors may not be compliant - contractual language needed

### Budget Constraints
- **Question**: What's Todd's budget for this project?
- **Impact**: Determines tier selection
- **Strategy**: Lead with Tier 2, show ROI vs. lawsuit costs

### Internal Resources
- **Question**: Who on City staff will be ongoing accessibility champions?
- **Impact**: Sustainability of compliance
- **Action**: Identify 2-3 staff for intensive training
