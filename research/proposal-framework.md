## City of Bowie ADA Title II Compliance

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-11  
**Meeting Target**: Week of December 16-20, 2025  
**Audience**: Todd (Communications Director), City Manager, IT Director, possibly Legal/Procurement

---

## PRESENTATION STRUCTURE (45-60 Minutes)

### Opening (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish credibility and urgency

**Script**:
> "Thank you for meeting with us today. By April 24, 2026, the Department of Justice requires that all state and local government web content and mobile apps meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. That's just 16 months away.
>
> We're not here today with a theoretical proposal—we've actually already scanned your website and identified specific issues. Let me show you what we found."

**Visuals**:
- Title slide with City of Bowie logo
- Timeline graphic showing April 2026 deadline
- DOJ logo/reference

**Tone**: Professional, helpful (not fear-mongering)

---

### The Demo (15 minutes) ⭐ CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR
**Objective**: Prove capability and show immediate value

**Setup**:
1. **Live Scanner Demonstration**
   - Show Terminal/Command Prompt running scanner
   - Real-time scan of cityofbowie.org
   - Generate report in 30-60 seconds

2. **HTML Report Walkthrough**
   - Open report in browser (visual and professional)
   - Highlight key statistics:
     - Total issues found
     - Critical errors count
     - Most common issues
   - Click into specific examples

3. **Specific Issue Examples**
   - Show 2-3 actual problems on their website:
     - Missing alt text on images
     - Color contrast failures
     - Form labeling issues
     - Navigation keyboard accessibility
   - Demonstrate with screen reader (if time permits)

**Script**:
> "Here's what we found on cityofbowie.org:
> - [X] total accessibility issues
> - [Y] critical errors that would fail a DOJ audit
> - The most common issue is [specific problem], appearing [Z] times
>
> This is what the Department of Justice will be looking for. The good news is, these are fixable."

**Why This Works**:
- **NOT A POWERPOINT** → Competitors will bring slides, you bring working software
- **IMMEDIATE VALUE** → They learn something useful before contract signed
- **PROOF OF COMPETENCE** → You've already done research on their organization
- **BUILDS URGENCY** → Real issues are harder to ignore than hypotheticals

---

### The Problem (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Frame the challenge and consequences

**Key Points**:
1. **Federal Mandate**
   - ADA Title II applies to all government entities
   - April 24, 2026 deadline (non-negotiable)
   - DOJ enforcement includes investigations, lawsuits, consent decrees

2. **Scope of Compliance**
   - Website (primary focus)
   - Documents (PDFs, Word, PowerPoint)
   - Third-party vendors (Munis, ActiveNet, etc.)
   - Mobile apps (if applicable)

3. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**
   - Legal risk (DOJ complaints, lawsuits)
   - Reputational damage
   - Exclusion of residents with disabilities
   - Potential fines and remediation costs

**Visual**:
- One slide with three columns: "What's Required" | "Deadline" | "Consequences"
- Keep it factual, not fear-based

**Script**:
> "This isn't just about avoiding lawsuits—though that's important. It's about ensuring all Bowie residents can access city services, pay bills, register for recreation programs, and engage with their government. Right now, residents using screen readers or keyboard-only navigation face significant barriers."

### Leveraging Existing Tools (5 minutes) ⭐ KEY SELLING POINT
**Objective**: Show you're cost-conscious and strategic

**Key Message**: "You don't need to buy a bunch of new software. You already have most of what you need."

**Tools They Already Own**:
| Tool | Current Status | Our Approach |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Adobe Acrobat Pro | Owned via CD-ROM | Train staff on accessibility features |
| Microsoft Office | Already deployed | Enable built-in accessibility checkers |
| OneDrive/SharePoint | Underutilized | Position as "compliant by default" |
| CivicPlus CMS | Website platform | Supplement with comprehensive scanning |
| Laserfiche | Document management | Add governance layer |

**What We Add**:
- Expertise (WCAG certification, accessibility specialists)
- Tools (Pa11y scanner, Power BI dashboard - **free or low-cost**)
- Training (custom to City of Bowie)
- Ongoing monitoring (dashboard subscription)

**Script**:
> "We're not here to sell you expensive software you don't need. You already have Adobe Acrobat Pro, Microsoft Office, SharePoint—these are powerful tools with built-in accessibility features.
>
> What we bring is expertise: knowing how to use these tools correctly, training your staff, and building a monitoring system so you stay compliant. We'll also introduce a few free, open-source tools like Pa11y—the same scanner you just saw—to automate ongoing monitoring."

**Why This Works**:
- Positions you as strategic partner, not vendor
- Todd mentioned wanting to leverage OneDrive/SharePoint → align with his vision
- Budget-friendly (critical for government)

---

### Pricing Options (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Present tiered pricing, guide to Tier 2

**Tiering Strategy**: Good / Better / Best

#### Tier 1: Essential Compliance ($65,000-75,000)
**What's Included**:
- Website audit + remediation
- Basic Power BI dashboard
- Website staff training (Communications team)
- Quarterly monitoring (Year 1)

**What's NOT Included**:
- Document remediation (minimal only)
- Vendor assessment (basic VPAT review only)
- Comprehensive training
- Advanced governance

**For Organizations That**:
- Have minimal document volume
- High confidence in vendor compliance
- Tight budget constraints
- Can handle some tasks in-house

#### Tier 2: Recommended Full Compliance ($95,000-110,000) ⭐ LEAD WITH THIS
**What's Included**:
- **Everything in Tier 1, PLUS:**
- Document remediation (Laserfiche inventory + priority docs)
- Vendor compliance assessment (VPATs, testing, contracts)
- Comprehensive training (4 courses, all staff)
- Advanced Power BI dashboard (vendor tracking, training metrics)
- Policy & governance framework
- Quarterly audits (Year 1)

**Why This Tier**:
- **Complete solution** (website + documents + vendors + training)
- Best value (most comprehensive)
- De-risks April 2026 deadline
- Builds sustainable compliance

**For Organizations That**:
- Want comprehensive coverage
- Value peace of mind
- Need vendor documentation
- Want to build internal capability

#### Tier 3: Enterprise / White-Glove ($120,000-140,000)
**What's Included**:
- **Everything in Tier 2, PLUS:**
- SiteImprove subscription (enterprise monitoring, Year 1)
- Executive coaching (for City Manager, leadership)
- Advanced dashboard features (predictive analytics, mobile app)
- Dedicated account manager
- Monthly (not quarterly) audits
- Priority support (4-hour response time)

**For Organizations That**:
- Want enterprise-grade tools
- Need executive-level reporting
- High-risk tolerance (e.g., prior complaints)
- Larger budget

**Comparison Table**:
| Feature | Tier 1 | Tier 2 ⭐ | Tier 3 |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Website Compliance | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Document Remediation | Limited | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Vendor Assessment | Basic | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Advanced |
| Staff Training | 1 course | ✅ 4 courses | ✅ + Executive |
| Power BI Dashboard | Basic | ✅ Advanced | ✅ Enterprise |
| Governance Framework | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| SiteImprove | - | - | ✅ |
| Audit Frequency | Quarterly | Quarterly | Monthly |
| Support | Email | Email + Office Hours | Priority (4-hour) |
| **Investment** | **$65-75K** | **$95-110K** | **$120-140K** |

**Script**:
> "We recommend Tier 2: Recommended Full Compliance for the City of Bowie.
>
> Here's why: Tier 1 gets your website compliant, but doesn't address documents or vendors. Given that you have Laserfiche with [unknown volume] documents, and critical vendors like Munis and ActiveNet, Tier 1 leaves gaps.
>
> Tier 2 is comprehensive. It addresses every aspect of ADA Title II compliance—website, documents, vendors, training, governance—and builds your team's internal capability.
>
> Tier 3 is for organizations that want enterprise-grade tools like SiteImprove or have higher risk profiles. We can discuss if that's relevant, but Tier 2 gives you everything you need to meet the April 2026 deadline and sustain compliance."

**Negotiation Flexibility**:
- If they push back on budget, offer phased payment (e.g., 40% upfront, 30% at Month 6, 30% at completion)
- If they want to reduce scope, show what gets removed (e.g., "Without vendor assessment, you're exposed to liability from Munis non-compliance")
- If they want to add a la carte, price individual components

---

### Recurring Services (5 minutes)

- Pa11y automation monitoring
- Monthly executive summary reports
- Power BI license management
- Technical support (email + office hours)

**Value Proposition**:
> "Compliance isn't a one-time project—it's ongoing. New pages get added to your website, staff create new documents, vendors update their platforms. Our dashboard subscription ensures you stay compliant without needing to run scans manually or interpret technical reports."

#### Quarterly Audits: $2,000-4,000 per audit
**Includes**:
- Sample website pages (new content)

**When Needed**:
- Contract renewals
- Major vendor platform updates
- New vendors onboarded

**Total Recurring Revenue Opportunity**: $38,000-71,000/year

**Script**:
> "After the initial 12-month implementation, we recommend ongoing monitoring and support. This includes:
> - Dashboard management (so you always have current data)
> - Quarterly audits (catch issues before they become problems)
> - Annual training refreshers (for new staff and policy updates)
>
> Think of it like your HVAC maintenance contract—regular check-ups prevent costly emergencies. Our recurring services ensure you stay compliant and avoid scrambling if the DOJ comes knocking."

>
> Second, we're not a typical consulting firm. We combine human expertise—certified accessibility specialists—with automation and AI tools. That means high quality without the high cost of manual labor for everything.
>

### Case for Action (3 minutes)
**Objective**: Create urgency (without fear-mongering)

**Key Messages**:

1. **Timeline is Tight**
   - April 24, 2026 = 16 months away
   - Our roadmap is 12-18 months
   - Starting in January 2026 gives 15 months → buffer of 3 months
   - Every month of delay reduces buffer

2. **Risk Increases with Inaction**
   - DOJ complaints can be filed by any resident
   - Lawsuits are expensive (legal fees + settlements)
   - Consent decrees can mandate specific actions (less control)

3. **Early Movers Have Advantage**
   - Less competitive pressure for consultants (we have capacity now)
   - More time to test and refine
   - Can learn from our implementation (not rushing)

4. **This Work Has Benefits Beyond Compliance**
   - Better user experience for all residents (not just those with disabilities)
   - Improved SEO (accessible websites rank better)
   - Modern document management (SharePoint migration)
   - Staff skill development

**Script**:
> "Here's why we recommend starting in January:
>
> You have 16 months until the deadline. Our roadmap is 12-18 months. That gives you a 3-4 month buffer if anything goes wrong—and in government projects, something usually does.
>
> Beyond compliance, this work improves your overall digital presence. Accessible websites are more user-friendly for everyone, not just people with disabilities. You'll have better document management, a trained staff, and modern governance practices.
>
> The risk of waiting is that you're under time pressure, potentially making hasty decisions, and reducing quality. Let's do this right."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Objection 1: "This is too expensive."
**Response**:
> "I understand budget is a concern. Let me put this in perspective:
> - The average ADA website lawsuit settlement is $10,000-$50,000, plus legal fees of $50,000-$150,000. That's $60K-$200K if you lose.
> - Our Tier 2 proposal is $95-110K and includes comprehensive compliance—website, documents, vendors, training, governance. It's insurance against a much larger cost.
> - We can also explore phased payments or starting with Tier 1 and adding components later. But cutting scope increases risk."

**Alternative**:
- Offer payment plan (40% / 30% / 30%)
- Suggest Tier 1 with add-ons (but highlight gaps)
- Show ROI: improved user experience → more online service usage → staff time savings

### Objection 2: "Can't we just use CivicPlus's built-in checker?"
**Response**:
> "CivicPlus has a basic accessibility checker, which is great—we'll train your team to use it. However, it only scans CivicPlus modules. It doesn't check:
> - Third-party embeds (YouTube, social media)
> - Custom code or JavaScript
> - PDFs linked from your site
> - Color contrast across all pages
> - Manual testing (keyboard, screen readers)
>
> CivicPlus is a good starting point, but it's not sufficient for full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. We'll supplement it with comprehensive tools and manual testing."

### Objection 3: "We'll just fix it ourselves."
**Response**:
> "That's definitely an option, and we support building internal capacity. However, consider:
> - Do you have WCAG 2.1 AA expertise on staff? (Most organizations don't)
> - Accessibility testing requires specialized skills (screen readers, ARIA, keyboard navigation)
> - The April 2026 deadline is tight—15 months—and your staff likely have full-time jobs already
> - If you miss something, the DOJ won't accept 'we tried our best' as a defense
>
> Our approach includes training your staff, so you CAN maintain compliance after we leave. But getting to compliance requires expertise you may not have in-house."

### Objection 4: "Can we just hire one person to do this?"
**Response**:
> "One person with the right skills could handle ongoing maintenance, but the initial lift requires a team:
> - Website accessibility specialist (manual testing, remediation)
> - Document remediation specialist (if you have 500+ PDFs)
> - Developer (for code fixes)
> - Trainer (for staff training)
> - Project manager (to coordinate)
>
> A single hire would take 2-3 years to complete this work, well past the deadline. Our team of 3-4 specialists can do it in 12-18 months.
>
> After implementation, we can help you hire an Accessibility Coordinator for ongoing maintenance—that's part of Phase 6 (Governance)."

### Objection 5: "We need to talk to other vendors."
**Response**:
> "Absolutely, you should do due diligence. When you talk to other vendors, ask them:
> 1. Can you show us a working demo of your scanning tool right now? (Most will say no)
> 2. Do you train our staff to maintain compliance, or are we dependent on you forever?
> 3. Do you use our existing tools (Adobe, Office, SharePoint), or do we need to buy new software?
> 4. What's your approach to vendor compliance? (Many ignore this)
> 5. Can we see a sample dashboard or deliverable?
>
> We're confident that our hybrid approach—human expertise + automation, using tools you already own, with a focus on sustainability—will stand out."

### Objection 6: "What if WCAG standards change?"
**Response**:
> "Great question. WCAG 2.1 Level AA is the federal standard for the April 2026 deadline, and it's unlikely to change before then.
>
> However, WCAG 2.2 was released in 2023, and WCAG 3.0 is in development. Here's our approach:
> - We'll build to WCAG 2.1 AA (the legal requirement)
> - Our dashboard and scanning tools are configurable—we can update rulesets as standards evolve
> - Our annual training refreshers include policy updates if standards change
> - If WCAG 2.2 becomes required, most of your work is already done (it's additive, not a rewrite)
>
> You're future-proofed."

## PRESENTATION TIPS

### Do's:
✅ **Show the demo first** (differentiate immediately)  
✅ **Use their language** (Todd mentioned "OneDrive/SharePoint"—reference this)  
✅ **Be consultative, not salesy** (you're solving a problem, not pushing product)  
✅ **Ask questions** ("How many documents do you estimate in Laserfiche?")  
✅ **Show empathy** ("We know government budgets are tight—that's why we're maximizing existing tools")  
✅ **Bring printed materials** (they can review later)  
✅ **Offer to answer questions anytime** (leave contact info)

### Don'ts:
❌ **Don't fear-monger** ("You'll get sued!" is off-putting)  
❌ **Don't oversell** (they can smell desperation)  
❌ **Don't badmouth competitors** (unprofessional)  
❌ **Don't use jargon** (explain WCAG, ARIA, etc. in plain language)  
❌ **Don't assume budget** (ask about constraints)  
❌ **Don't rush** (let them process and ask questions)
