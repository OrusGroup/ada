## 1. TECHNICAL VIABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Can This Be Built/Delivered?
**YES** - with high confidence.

#### Technical Requirements (All Achievable)
✅ **Gap Analysis**
- Tools exist: WAVE, Axe, SiteImprove, Pa11y
- Methodology well-established
- Can be completed in 2-4 weeks

✅ **Website Accessibility Audit**
- Standard WCAG 2.1 AA auditing process
- Automated + manual testing available
- Your team can deliver this

✅ **Document Remediation**
- Adobe Acrobat Pro (they already have)
- CommonLook, Equidox for scale
- Process-driven, achievable

✅ **Staff Training Program**
- Content creation: accessible docs, CivicPlus usage
- Delivery: live + recorded sessions
- Standard service offering

✅ **Monitoring Dashboard**
- SiteImprove, Monsido (SaaS options)
- Custom Power BI dashboard (you build)
- API integrations available

✅ **Vendor Assessment**
- VPAT review process (standard)
- Manual testing protocols exist
- Deliverable in scope

#### Primary Technical Risks
⚠️ **Third-Party System Access**
- Risk: Vendors (Munis, ActiveNet) may not provide access
- Mitigation: Start with public-facing interfaces, request VPATs early

⚠️ **Document Volume Unknown**
- Risk: Laserfiche + file servers may contain 10,000+ documents
- Mitigation: Inventory first, prioritize public-facing, phase remediation

⚠️ **CivicPlus Limitations**
- Risk: Their accessibility checker gives false confidence
- Mitigation: Your audit will reveal true gaps (value proposition)

⚠️ **Timeline Constraint**
- Risk: 16 months is tight for large organizations
- Mitigation: Phased approach, prioritize high-risk areas

**CONCLUSION**: Technically achievable. Risks are manageable with proper planning.

## 2. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

### What Existing Solutions Address This Problem?

#### Enterprise Accessibility Vendors
1. **Siteimprove** (Denmark-based, major player)
   - Strength: Comprehensive platform, monitoring, training
   - Weakness: Expensive, may be overkill for single municipality

2. **Deque Systems** (US-based, Axe products)
   - Strength: Strong testing tools, government clients
   - Weakness: Focus on testing, less on full-service remediation

3. **Level Access** (formerly SSB Bart Group)
   - Strength: Full-service, government experience
   - Weakness: High cost, typically Fortune 500 focus

4. **AudioEye** (publicly traded)
   - Strength: Automated overlay solutions
   - Weakness: Overlay approach controversial, not full compliance

#### Local/Regional Accessibility Consultants
- Smaller firms offering auditing + remediation
- Often used by municipalities
- Your direct competition

#### City's Current Approach
- CivicPlus (included with CMS) - insufficient
- In-house with Adobe Acrobat - no process/training
- **Gap**: No comprehensive strategy or expertise

### Your Differentiation

#### Why City of Bowie Should Choose You

1. **You Understand Their Ecosystem**
   - Already familiar with their systems
   - Meeting established trust
   - Local/regional presence (implied)

2. **Comprehensive Approach**
   - Not just testing → full roadmap + implementation
   - Training + tools + ongoing monitoring
   - They don't want to cobble together multiple vendors

3. **Pragmatic, Achievable Solutions**
   - Working within their existing tools (Adobe, Office, CivicPlus)
   - Integration with OneDrive (Todd's priority)
   - Phased approach to meet 2026 deadline

4. **Recurring Relationship, Not One-Off**
   - Dashboard subscription model
   - Ongoing training and updates
   - Partner, not vendor

5. **Realistic Risk Assessment**
   - You've identified what CivicPlus can't do
   - Third-party vendor exposure
   - Document archive challenges
   - (They need someone who tells the truth)

### Market Demand Evidence

#### Federal Mandate = Guaranteed Demand
- Every US city >50,000 population must comply
- April 2026 deadline is non-negotiable
- Cities face lawsuits for non-compliance
- No option to "opt out"

#### Budget Availability
- ADA compliance is legally required expenditure
- Cities cannot claim lack of budget as defense
- Capital improvement / IT modernization budgets
- Federal ADA enforcement carries penalties

#### Industry Trends
- Accessibility lawsuits increasing year-over-year
- Cities prioritizing compliance (risk mitigation)
- Demand for training + tools + monitoring growing

**Market Demand Rating: 10/10** (legally mandated)

- Document inventory
- Vendor assessment
- Staff interviews
- Deliverable: Gap Analysis Report

**Phase 2: Roadmap & Strategy (2-3 weeks)**
- Compliance roadmap creation
- Prioritization framework
- Resource planning
- Governance design
- Deliverable: ADA Compliance Roadmap

**Phase 3: Remediation (6-9 months)**
- Website fixes (HTML, ARIA, contrast, headings)
- Document remediation (prioritized)
- Template creation
- CivicPlus optimization
- Ongoing parallel work across departments

**Phase 4: Training (3-4 months, overlapping with Phase 3)**
- Training program development
- Live training sessions (multiple departments)
- Recorded training library
- Documentation and checklists
- Deliverable: Certified staff

**Phase 5: Monitoring Setup (1-2 months)**
- Dashboard development
- Integration with city systems
- Alert configuration
- Reporting templates
- Deliverable: Live dashboard

**Phase 6: Validation & Launch (1-2 months before deadline)**
- Full compliance audit
- Third-party validation (optional)
- Documentation of compliance
- Final training refreshers
- Go-live: April 2026

#### Timeline: 12-15 months (Fits within 16-month window)

### Hardest Technical Challenges

1. **Scale of Document Remediation**
   - Unknown volume in Laserfiche + file servers
   - Manual remediation time-intensive
   - Solution: Prioritize public-facing, batch processing tools

2. **Third-Party Vendor Compliance**
   - Munis, ActiveNet may not be compliant
   - City has limited leverage over vendors
   - Solution: Document vendor gaps, push for VPATs, contractual requirements

3. **Organizational Change Management**
   - Staff must adopt new workflows
   - Communications manages website (not IT)
   - Cross-departmental coordination required
   - Solution: Executive sponsorship (Todd), champions in each dept

4. **Defining "Compliance" Across Disparate Systems**
   - CivicPlus, Laserfiche, OneDrive, file servers, third-party systems
   - Each has different accessibility capabilities
   - Solution: Unified governance framework, clear standards

5. **Ongoing Monitoring Post-Launch**
   - Compliance isn't one-time
   - New content created daily
   - Solution: Dashboard + training + quarterly audits (your recurring service)
