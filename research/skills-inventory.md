## PART 6: SUBCONTRACTING STRATEGY

### When to Subcontract vs. Hire
**Subcontract**:
- Specialized short-term work (document remediation, policy writing)
- Skills you don't have and don't want to build
- Work that fluctuates (can scale up/down)
- Testing and QA (lower-risk tasks)

**Hire (Employee or Long-Term Contractor)**:
- Core expertise (web accessibility specialist)
- Client-facing roles (project manager)
- Recurring work (dashboard management, ongoing audits)
- IP/quality control (dashboard code, training materials)

### Recommended Subcontractors to Pre-Identify

1. **Document Remediation Firm**
   - Example: Able Docs, 3Play Media, etc.
   - Pre-negotiate rates
   - Backup if volume exceeds capacity

2. **Accessibility Audit Firm** (Backup/Overflow)
   - Example: Deque, Level Access, etc.
   - For VPAT validation or second opinion

3. **Power BI Freelancer**
   - Identify 2-3 developers
   - Test with small project before City of Bowie

4. **Training Video Producer**
   - Local videographer
   - For high-quality training modules

## PART 7: TEAM COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION

### Tools
- **Project Management**: Microsoft Planner or Project (City has M365)

2. **Front-End Development** - Remediation coding (contractor fine)
3. **Training Development** - Can use templates and AI assistance
4. **Policy Writing** - Short-term engagement

### If You're Solo + AI-Assisted
**Invest in learning**:
1. IAAP WAS Certification (2-3 months, $500-1,000)
2. Power BI skills (1 month, free)
3. NVDA proficiency (2 weeks, free)

**Subcontract**:
