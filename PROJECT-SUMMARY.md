## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Strategic Positioning

**Your Competitive Advantage**:
1. **Working Software** - Competitors bring PowerPoints, you bring a functioning scanner
2. **Immediate Value** - Give them useful data before contract signed
3. **Hybrid Approach** - Human expertise + AI efficiency (not one or the other)
4. **No Vendor Lock-In** - Use their existing tools (Adobe, Office, SharePoint)
5. **Sustainability Focus** - Training and capability building (not just fix-and-leave)
6. **Recurring Revenue** - Dashboard subscription model ($2K-4K/month ongoing)

**Lead With**: Tier 2 (Recommended Full Compliance) at $95K-110K
- Comprehensive (website + documents + vendors + training)
- Best value
- Addresses all April 2026 requirements
- Builds internal capability

**Differentiation**: Demo the scanner FIRST (first 15 minutes of meeting)

### Technical Decisions

**Tools We Recommend**:
- **Scanning**: Pa11y (free, open-source) + Axe DevTools (free browser extension)
- **Dashboard**: Custom Power BI (they already have M365)
- **Document Remediation**: Adobe Acrobat Pro (they already own it)
- **Training**: Custom materials (we create, they own)

**Why Not SaaS** (SiteImprove, Monsido):
- Expensive ($20K-50K/year)
- Vendor lock-in
- Less customizable
- Power BI is better fit (already in their ecosystem)

### Staffing Recommendations

**If You're Solo + AI-Assisted**:
- **Invest in**: IAAP WAS Certification (2-3 months, $500-1,000)
- **Learn**: Power BI (1 month, free), NVDA screen reader (2 weeks, free)
- **Subcontract**: Document remediation (if volume >500 docs), Power BI build (if no time to learn)

**If Building a Team**:
- **Hire First**: Web Accessibility Specialist (WCAG expert, IAAP certified)
- **Hire Second**: Power BI Developer (dashboard is recurring revenue)
- **Contract**: Document remediation specialist, training developer, front-end developer

### Pricing Strategy

**One-Time Implementation**:
- Tier 1 (Essential): $65K-75K (website only, minimal docs/vendors)
- **Tier 2 (Recommended)**: $95K-110K (comprehensive, best value) ⭐
- Tier 3 (Enterprise): $120K-140K (white-glove, SiteImprove included)

**Recurring Services** (Post-Implementation):
- Dashboard subscription: $2K-4K/month ($24K-48K/year)
- Quarterly audits: $2K-4K per audit ($8K-16K/year)
- Annual training refreshers: $3K-5K/year
- Vendor reassessments: $1K-2K per vendor (as needed)
- **Total Recurring Revenue**: $38K-71K/year

**Payment Terms** (If Budget Constrained):
- 40% upfront (upon contract signing)
- 30% at Month 6 (midpoint milestone)
- 30% at completion (final deliverables)

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: They Think It's Too Expensive
**Mitigation**: 
- Show ROI (lawsuit costs $60K-200K vs. $95K-110K comprehensive solution)
- Offer payment plan (40% / 30% / 30%)
- Present Tier 1 option (but highlight gaps)

### Risk 2: They Want to "Wait and See"
**Mitigation**:
- Timeline urgency (16 months → 12-month project → 4-month buffer)
- Every month of delay reduces buffer
- DOJ enforcement is already happening (cite examples if available)

### Risk 3: They Have Other Vendors to Evaluate
**Mitigation**:
- Your demo is unique (working software, not promises)
- Ask them to request demos from competitors (most won't have one)
- Position recurring services as long-term partnership, not transactional

### Risk 4: Scope Creep During Project
**Mitigation**:
- Clear SOW with deliverables and exclusions
- Change order process for new scope
- Monthly status meetings to align expectations

### Risk 5: Document Volume Exceeds Estimate
**Mitigation**:
- ASK IN MEETING: "How many PDFs are in Laserfiche?"
- Tier pricing assumes 500-1,000 docs (make this explicit)
- If >1,000 docs, add Equidox batch processing ($5K-20K/year)

---

## 📝 OPEN QUESTIONS FOR TODD (Ask at Meeting)

1. **Document Volume**: How many PDFs are currently in Laserfiche? (Impacts Phase 2 budget)
2. **Vendor List**: Beyond Munis and ActiveNet, what other vendors with public-facing interfaces do you use?
3. **Budget Authority**: What's the procurement threshold? (Do we need competitive bids?)
4. **Internal Resources**: Who on your team would be the Accessibility Coordinator after implementation?
5. **Training Capacity**: How many staff would need training? (All staff? Just Communications/IT?)
6. **Timeline Preference**: Is January 2026 start feasible, or do you need more time for procurement?
7. **Existing Initiatives**: Is Todd's SharePoint/OneDrive modernization effort already budgeted? (Potential to align)
8. **Pain Points**: Have you received any accessibility complaints or DOJ inquiries? (Risk assessment)

## 🏁 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For the Proposal Meeting

**DO**:
1. **Lead with the demo** (first 15 minutes) - This is your differentiator
2. **Show empathy** - "We know government budgets are tight"
3. **Be consultative** - "What are your biggest concerns about accessibility?"
4. **Highlight existing tools** - "You already have Adobe Acrobat Pro and Microsoft 365"
5. **Frame as partnership** - "We're training your team to sustain compliance"

**DON'T**:
1. Don't fear-monger - "You'll get sued!" is off-putting
2. Don't oversell - They can smell desperation
3. Don't badmouth competitors - Unprofessional
4. Don't use jargon - Explain WCAG, ARIA in plain language
5. Don't assume budget - Ask about constraints

### After the Meeting

**If They Say Yes**:
- Draft SOW immediately (within 48 hours)
- Schedule kickoff for mid-January 2026
- Assign team members (or start hiring)

**If They Say Maybe**:
- Follow up weekly (gentle nudges, not pressure)
- Offer to meet with City Manager or Legal
- Provide additional information as requested

**If They Say No**:
- Ask why (learn for next client)
- Offer to be a resource (stay in touch)
- Pivot to other government clients (same scanner, same approach)
